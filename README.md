# Anti-AFK-rs

This project is a program with a website frontend. Rocket.rs is the webhosting framework used. The application will repeat the said key.

## Features

- Repeating a key.
- Key can be inputted from frontend.
- Delay can be inputted from frontend.
- Can quit the backend from frontend.

## Why did I create this?

I've been interested in desktop apps with website frontends for a while, they first confused me until I realized they were just a backend for a website.
Figuring that out I decided to open a Rocket.rs project to create an anti-afk application.

## Notice

Most video games DO NOT allow this type of application. This was a learning experience for me. I published this because I thought someone might find it helpful to see the source code. Don't use this with malicous intent.
